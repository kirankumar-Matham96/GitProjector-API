# GitProjector

## Tasks

- User CRUD - done
- Authentication - done
- Handling errors globally - done

- Github API setup - done (can add more if needed)

  Difficulties:

  - Had some difficulty utilizing the APIs

  Solution:

  - Read some documentation from GitHub Docs.
  - Took references from the tutorials.

- Fetch GitHub repo data and return - done
- Globalizing the git operations for anyone. (anyone can login and use this api/app)

  Motivation:

  - Wanted to make the application public, not for myself only.

  Difficulties:

  difficulty-1:

  - How to make it not utilize my personalized access key?
  - It should be taking the authentication from the user, not the developer.

  Solution:

  - Referred tutorials.
  - Utilized the "auth-oauth-device" packege from npm to make it possible.

  difficulty-2:
  - I can use "auth-oauth-device" package and make it work with my terminal. But when UI is connected, how can I make the user see this code and let him/her authenticate for the next step?

- Validations
- test cases
- documentation (function/class vise)
- swagger documentation for the users
- readme
